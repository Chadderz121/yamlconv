yamlconv
  by Chadderz

Converts between the BYAML file format and XML.

For documentation on the BYAML format see:
http://mk8.tockdom.com/wiki/BYAML_%28File_Format%29

Conversion
----------

The conversion procedure begins at the root node. It is encoded as the root
XML node with name "yaml". Every sub-node is then recursively converted.
Value nodes may either be converted to XML attributes or XML elements.
Integers are encoded directly, booleans are encoded as "true" or "false"
and floats are encoded as the numeric representation followed by an "f".
A string is encoded as the inner text of an XML element with the attribute
"type" set to "string". A path is encoded as a series of "point" elements
with attributes "x", "y", "z", "nx", "ny", "nz" and "val". The container
element of the path has attribute "type" equal to "path". Finally, arrays
are encoded as a series of "value" elements with the container having
attribute "type" equal to "array" and dictionaries are encoded as a series
of named elements or attributes.

Examples
--------

The following is an example of the output of yamlconv showing all features
mentioned above.

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <yaml float_field_example="1.0f" int_field_example="0"
          bool_field_example="true">
      <string_field_example type="string">Hello!</string_field_example>
      <path_example type="path">
        <point x="0f" y="0f" z="0f" nx="0f" ny="1f" nz="0f" val="0" />
        <point x="1f" y="0f" z="0f" nx="0f" ny="1f" nz="0f" val="0" />
      </path_example>
      <array_example type="array">
        <value sample_int="0" />
        <value sample_int="1" />
      </array_example>
      <empty_array type="array" />
      <dictionary_example>
        <attr type="string">Hi!</attr>
      </dictionary_example>
      <empty_dictionary />
    </yaml>
